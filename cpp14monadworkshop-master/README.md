A workshop on monads with C++14
-------------------------------

Meetup C/C++ de Madrid, January 15h 2015

During the workshop we will explore the basics of monadic theory in the context of C++14. Format is based on a bunch of 5-min exercises that the attendants are expected to complete along the way, with solutions provided and commented publicly.

### Prerequisites
* You are expected to be reasonably fluent with some post-2003 C++ stuff
  * `auto`
  * `std::function`, lambda functions,  generic lambda functions
  * Function return type deduction, trailing return type declaration
  * Template template parameters (this is C++03, anyway)
  * `decltype`, `std::declval`
* You are encouraged to pre-read about functional programming and monads
  * For instance, go to https://github.com/joaquintides/usingstdcpp2014 (in Spanish)
*  You are required to bring a computer with
  *  Internet access (hopefully provided by host)
  * A C++14 compiler such as GCC 4.9 (`-std=c++1y`) with a recent Boost distro
  * Alternatively,  you can use an online environment such as [Coliru](http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com)
